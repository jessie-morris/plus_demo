# Henkel Proposal

## Front end components:

* Safety Cross
* Quality Q
* Shift Results
* Current Team
* OEE by shift results
* Production (Plan vs Actual cons)
* Daily Trends (OEE, Scrap)
* General text grid
  * Hourly Production
  * Top issues
  * Actions within the Team
  * External Support Actions
  * Change over tracking
  * Speed/Changeover Matrix

## Additional Front End Concerns

* Building a landing page user experience for the iPad
* Building a total view of the "board" for the tv
* Ability to wipe/snapshot the board

## Backend components

* Web socket server for capturing and broadcasting board events
* Ability for this data to be persisted on server outage
* Ability to wipe/snapshot the board

## Assumptions:

* Handwriting functionality will be accomplished by iPad custom keyboards
    * We can do research into this as part of the proposal if desired.
* The backend layer will need to be hosted in the cloud or on-premise
    * Our initial recommendation is cloud.
* Data will not be persisted in the first phase.
* All user input will happen on iPad devices which have a different interface than the display only board interface
* To reduce costs this needs to be access-restricted via network rules
    * For first phase, company policy will need to direct who can make edits to the board
    * i.e. There will be not sign in / authorization
* The TV display will need to be hooked up to a device with network/internet access such as a Intel NUC, Chromecast, or miniature computer.
* There will be a DX need for developing the charts and optimizing UX.


Questions:

* Are we delivering any hardware as part of our deliverables?
    * If so is this part of the budget.
* How much do we work on this effort before it is cleared from a business/proposal standpoint?
